	<p style="color:hotpink; text-align: center; font-size: 18pt;">What if I were a worm? But alas, who is to say that I am not! Oh to be a worm writhing in dirt for the sake of humaity and the nature of all. How is the toil of the proletariat any different than that of the meek earthworm? Do we not work in the dirt? Do we not offer a supply of resources for those above us? I dare to image the only difference is the joy recieved by the worm for his hard work.</p>
